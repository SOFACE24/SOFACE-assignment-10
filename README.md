# 270191U025-Software-Architecture-assignment-10

During this hand-in you will practice the following:

- analyze cyclomatic complexity of a program by hand
- Implement unit-tests that ensures full coverage based on this analysis

## Cyclomatic Complexity

Cyclomatic Complexity is a metric that can be used as a proxy for the complexity of a program.
Specifically, the metric measures the number of independent paths through a piece of software, i.e. how many different combinations of unique actions are made possible by the conditional statements of a program.

The concept of cyclomatic complexity is closely tied to the concept of a _program control graph_ which is a way to represent the structure of a computer program using directed graphs.
Each node of the graph represents a block of code that is executed sequentially, such assignment statements or performing arithmetic.
Nodes corresponding to conditionals causes the graph to split into different paths.

Conditional in C/C++ include:

- `if`, `if else`, and `else`
- `while`
- `do while`
- `switch`

A short summary of the different construct can be seen in the image below:

### Common Confusion Points

- if statements always have implicit else

  ```cpp
  if (sum > threshold)
  {
     sum = threshold
  }
  else
  {
     // do nothing
  }

  // is equivalent to
  if (sum > threshold)
  {
     sum = threshold
  }
  // else is omitted since it does nothing
  ```

- Edge from terminal to start node should _not_ be counted in the V(g) formula, this is introduced when counting cycles.
- Compound statements
- V(g) can be calculated for different portions of a program, like a single function. Traditionally, you would not count the complexity of other functions being called.

### Exercise

**For drawing I recommend using <a href="www.diagrams.net">drawio</a>.**

For the following functions defined in `snippets.hpp`:

- `min`
- `SortedVector::insert`
- `SortedVector::contains`
- `SortedVector::binary_search`
- `SortedVector::binary_insert`

Do the following:

- Draw the control graph
- Calculate V(g) using the formula
- Calculate V(g) by listing the number of independent cyclic paths
- Save image as `[name of function].png`,

**Ensure that each image clearly indicates the calculations**


<!-- ### Test Coverage (OPTIONAL)


``` bash
sudo apt install lcov
```

To run coverage:

```bash
lcov --capture --directory build/ --output-file coverage.info
genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage_info
```

If you get the following message you must run the test suite:
``` bash
Capturing coverage data from build/
Found gcov version: 9.3.0
Using intermediate gcov format
Scanning build/ for .gcda files ...
geninfo: WARNING: no .gcda files found in build/ - skipping!
Finished .info-file creation
Reading data file coverage.info
genhtml: ERROR: no valid records found in tracefile coverage.info
[2]+  Done
``

Open `coverage_info/index.html` to view report:
``` bash
firefox converage_info/index.html
```
